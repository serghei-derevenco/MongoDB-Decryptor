# Lab 7: Database Security
### Author: *Serghei Derevenco*
-----
## Objectives:
1. Create a MongoDB database which would contain some secured sensitive data (protected
via 2-way encryption);  
2. Create an application which would display the data contained in the database (both
common data and the decrypted sensitive data);  
3. Make sure that the sensitive data can only be accessed via your application (i.e. it is
secure).

## Technologies
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language  
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database
-----
## To Use
* Firstly, clone this repository using [Git](https://git-scm.com) or download `.zip` archive with project.  
* Secondly, if your OS is Windows, you will need to [install Python](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) language to be able to execute the project (In other types of OS [Python](https://www.python.org/) is installed by default).  
* Finally, `cd` into the folder with project and run `python main.py` to start application.
